{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "npm install && npm run build"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start",

```

Or delete `railway.json` entirely and try creating a `Procfile` instead (no file extension):
```
web: npm start
